there is nothing to see here.

## idea

jsga.me will someday be a *programming game* platform: a small
framework that you can use to develop, deploy, and/or play 
computer games where rather than rolling the dice, you write some
code.  jsga.me will both be built with and focus on teaching 
javascript.
